# Sex ratio evolution in response to male attractiveness
## Numerical iterations in Mathematica

The Mathematica sheet reproduces the numerical simulations shown in Figure 2 of:  
Fawcett, Kuijper, Weissing & Pen (2011) Sex-ratio control erodes sexual selection, revealing evolutionary feedback from adaptive plasticity. PNAS 108: 15925-15930. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1105721108

It takes about 1hr to run the numerical simulations and generate the graphs.
